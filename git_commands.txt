Git commands: (From Udacity "How to use Git course")


git init : initializes the directory for Git.
git add : adds a file from the working directory to the staging area
git commit : adds new files to the repository and/or adds new changes to repository.
git status : shows the current status of the staging area and repository

git diff : compares working directory with staging area
git diff --staging area : compares staging area with commit 1 (or the most recent commit).
git diff commit 1 commit 2 : compares commit 1 with commit 2.

Adding a repository on git:
1. select new repository
2. give it a name
3. leave as public
4. only include a readme if there are no commits

Refer to Udacity courseLesson 3 #5 for video explaining these commands
Adding the new repository as a remote on my computer:
1. copy the https url of the remote repository from github
2. In git bash:
	#git remote add origin https://(your remote repository address)
	#git remote (to see that it was added)
	#git remote -v (to the fetch and push addresses)
	#git push origin master


Add commits to Git Hub to existing repository:
	#git push origin master (remember that origin is what we use when making a new repository)


Using credential manager:

Pull from GitHub:
#git pull origin master


Forking: (these actions are taken on GitHub)
Login to GitHub
Locate the repository you want to fork
Click the fork icon


Cloning a Fork: From your computer
#git clone https://(the address of your repository)
Now, You do no need to add the fork on GitHub as a remote, because Git has done this already for you.
#git remote -v (Verify the fetch and push addresses)
